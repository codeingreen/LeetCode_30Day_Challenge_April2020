'''

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 

Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1

        def findHappy(n):
            
            if n == 1:
                print('n is equal 1')
                return True
            
            digits = []
            while n > 0:
                num = n % 10
                n = n // 10
                digits.append(num)
            
            print(' > ', digits)
            total = 0
            for digit in digits:
                total += digit **2
            print(total)
            return findHappy(total)
            
        if findHappy(n):
            print('find happy is true')
            return True

            print('find happy is true')
